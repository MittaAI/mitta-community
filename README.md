# Welcome to MittaAI
This is the community repository for MittaAI and SlothAI users. All code or examples here are covered by the [MIT software license](https://github.com/MittaAI/mitta-community/blob/main/LICENSE).

The SlothAI framework which runs MittaAI is located [here](https://github.com/kordless/SlothAI).

## Pipeline Cookbooks
The [cookbooks directory](./cookbooks) contains the example pipelines available for use on [MittaAI](https://mitta.ai)'s website.

## Instructions for Use
To use pipelines here, you will either need to create a [MittaAI account](https://mitta.ai), or install the [SlothAI framework](https://github.com/kordless/SlothAI) on Google Cloud.

For now, you will need a [FeatureBase Cloud](https://cloud.featurebase.com) account if you use a pipeline that needs storage.

SlothAI will eventually support other database storage layers.
