# RAG Indexing and Search Pipeline
This pipeline implements a RAG (retrieval augmented generation) indexing and querying pipeline system. Use it search texts for matches for prompt assembly.

Add the pipeline to [MittaAI](https://mitta.ai) from the `pipelines` page. Upload a file to the pipeline from the pipeline detail page. 

To see the results from a query, view the [callback log](https://mitta.ai/logs).
